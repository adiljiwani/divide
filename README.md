Ever been through the tedious process of splitting a bill between friends? Imagine if you could just take a picture of the receipt and settle the payment in seconds? 

Say hello to divide.

Divide is an iOS app which simplifies the process of splitting a bill with your friends. You can either manualy enter the receipt details (boring) or you can take a picture of the receipt and divide will look for the date and the amount.
